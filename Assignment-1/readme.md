## Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher
### Commands used in the game to reach the first ciphertext
+  go
+   read
+   enter
+  read

### Cryptosystem was used at this level
The encryption used was a simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher.
The digits were actually shifted by 4 places.

### Plaintext Space:
This is the first chamber of the caves. 
As you can see, there is nothing of 
interest in the chamber. Some of the later 
chambers will be more interesting than 
this one! the code used for this message 
is a simple substitution cipher in which 
digits have been shifted by 4 places.

### Observations used to figure out the cryptosystem
To figure out the original plaintext from the given ciphertext, frequency analysis was used. First, frequencies of all the letters in the ciphertext was calculated. In the ciphertext, 'y' was the most frequent character, so this was most likely to be an 'e' which is the most frequently occurring letter in English.  Also with the knowledge of the English grammar and language, we were able to figure out the obvious encrypted letters, i.e. a single 'p' in the ciphertext could only be an 'i' or an 'a'. Two and three lettered encrypted words  were figured out after certain replacements. With further replacements and (bruteforce on the shifting of digits):


### Mapping
Mapping between between the elements of plaintext space and the elements of ciphertext space:<br>
a -> p<br>
b -> o<br>
c -> i<br>
d -> u<br>
e -> y<br>
f -> t<br>
g -> r<br>
h -> e<br>
i -> w<br>
j -> #<br>
k -> #<br>
l -> k<br>
m -> j<br>
n -> h<br>
o -> g<br>
p -> f<br>
q -> d<br>
r -> s<br>
s -> a<br>
t -> m<br>
u -> n<br>
v -> b<br>
w -> v<br>
x -> #<br>
y -> xv
z -> # <br>
 
#<br>
j, k, x, y don't appear in the ciphertext.
